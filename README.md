tic-tac-toe
===========

This is a simple game of tic-tac-toe that I wrote in (mostly) vanilla Javascript.

Features:

- Sleek, functional game board
- Persistent score keeping via localstorage
- Cursor changes to display the current turn's piece over the game board
- Control the game with number pad on keyboard (it's 3x3... almost like it was made for tic-tac-toe)

To do:
- Create a backend with websockets to allow users to play against each other from different computers
